**Red Magician** is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable. 
This is also a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red Magician into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, new best friend, or anything else you want! 
[Installation is easy](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/), and you do NOT need to know anything about coding! Aside from installation and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:
* Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
* Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
* Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
* Stream alerts (Twitch, Hitbox, Beam)
* Slot machines
* Custom commands
* Imgur/gif search

Additionally, other modules (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing community of cog repositories. Including:
* Loggers
* Welcome messages setup
* Reminders
* Raffles
* Levels (increase a user's level based on participation)
* Quotes
* And much, much more!

Feel free to take a [peek](https://cogs.red/) at the official cog database!
